# Prompt Improver – Full-Stack Hero Section

This project was built as part of the **Full-Stack Vibe Coder** candidate task for **Stunning**.

The goal is to create a simple, real product experience that helps users turn a rough website idea into a clearer, more useful prompt they can use to build a website.

---

## 🧠 Approach

I focused on:

* Simplicity
* Clear user flow
* End-to-end functionality
* Product thinking over over-engineering

Rather than adding many features, I aimed to make one core feature feel complete, usable, and realistic.

---

## 🔄 User Flow

1. User enters a rough website idea (e.g. “online store”)
2. User submits the idea
3. Backend processes and improves the prompt
4. Frontend displays a clearer, structured version of the idea

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* Angular (Standalone Components)
* TypeScript
* CSS

**Backend**

* Node.js
* Express

## ⚙️ How Prompt Improvement Works

The backend enhances the user input by:

* Adding structure
* Clarifying the website purpose
* Suggesting core website sections
* Defining tone and style

The logic is intentionally simple, readable, and easy to extend.
