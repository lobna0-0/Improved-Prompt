Prompt Improver – Full-Stack Hero Section

This project was built as part of the Full-Stack Vibe Coder candidate task for Stunning.

The goal is to create a simple, real product experience that helps users turn a rough website idea into a clearer, more useful prompt they can use to build a website.

🧠 Approach

I focused on:

Simplicity

Clear user flow

End-to-end functionality

Product thinking over over-engineering

Rather than adding many features, I aimed to make one core feature feel complete, usable, and realistic.

🔄 User Flow

User enters a rough website idea (e.g. “online store”)

User submits the idea

Backend processes and improves the prompt

Frontend displays a clearer, structured version of the idea

🧩 Tech Stack
Frontend

Angular (Standalone Components)

TypeScript

CSS

Backend

Node.js

Express

⚙️ How Prompt Improvement Works

The backend enhances the user input by:

Adding structure

Clarifying the website purpose

Suggesting core website sections

Defining tone and style

The logic is intentionally simple, readable, and easy to extend.
